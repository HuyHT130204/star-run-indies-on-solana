# Vorld Authentication Service Configuration
# Copy this file to .env.local and fill in your actual values

# Vorld App ID - Get this from your Vorld dashboard
NEXT_PUBLIC_VORLD_APP_ID=your_vorld_app_id_here

# Auth Server URL - Your authentication server endpoint
# For development, you can leave this empty to use mock authentication
NEXT_PUBLIC_AUTH_SERVER_URL=https://your-auth-server.com

# Arena Server URL - WebSocket server for real-time features
NEXT_PUBLIC_ARENA_SERVER_URL=wss://your-arena-server.com

# Game API URL - Backend API for game data and rewards
NEXT_PUBLIC_GAME_API_URL=https://your-game-api.com

# Development Notes:
# - If NEXT_PUBLIC_AUTH_SERVER_URL is empty or the server is not available,
#   the app will automatically fall back to mock authentication
# - Mock authentication allows you to test the game without a real auth server
# - All authentication features will work locally with mock tokens
